Apollo Server 2, paired with the new Apollo Engine UI, provides all of the Optics Agent features together with new features such as error reporting, persisted queries, and CDN integrations. [Read the Apollo Engine setup guide for Apollo Server!](setup-node.html)

Server implementations in other languages can take advantage of Engine features by following the [setup instructions for the Engine Proxy](./setup-standalone.html).
