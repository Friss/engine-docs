<h2 id="selecting-plan">Selecting your Engine plan</h2>

#### Can I get a free trial of the Standard or Pro versions of Engine?

Yes, you can start a trial of Engine Pro — our most advanced plan — any time, no credit card required. At the end of the free trial you can select which version to continue with.

#### Is there a discount if I pre-pay for my Engine plan?

Yes, you can receive a 20% discount off month-to-month billing plans through a pre-paid, annual plan. You can switch from a monthly plan to an annual plan at any time. Get in touch with us from within the app or support@apollographql.com and we'll set it up for you.

#### Can I start on an Engine monthly plan and switch to annual later?

Absolutely, you can start on a monthly billing plan for Engine and switch to a pre-paid annual plan at any time. Get in touch with us from within the app or support@apollographql.com and we'll set it up for you.

#### How do I know what Engine plan I'm on and my current query volume?

You can view your Engine plan name and current query volume total for the current monthly period in the Settings page of your Engine account.

#### How do I request a downgrade to a lower volume plan or cancel my Engine plan?

* *Monthly plan customers:* You may request a downgrade or cancellation at any time during a monthly term. The downgrade or cancellation will take effect on your next monthly renewal date.
* *Annual plan customers:* Downgrades or cancellations are not possible during an annual term. Any downgrades or cancellations will take effect on your next annual renewal date.

#### Can I downgrade from a paid plan to a free Community plan?

Yes, you may request a downgrade from any paid plan to the free Engine Community plan (limited to 1M queries per month). Like other downgrades, this will take place at your next renewal date of your current paid plan (monthly or annual).

<h2 id="query-volume">Query volume</h2>

#### What happens if I exceed the query volume limit for the paid Engine plan I'm on?

* *Monthly plan customers:* We will automatically upgrade your monthly plan to the appropriate volume tier when you exceed the query volume limit for a plan during a monthly billing period. Your will be billed a pro-rated amount for the initial upgrade and the full amount of the new plan for subsequent monthly periods at your next billing date which remains unchanged.
* *Annual plan customers:* Engine will keep working if you exceed your volume tier during your annual subscription. Our team will work with you on upgrading your plan based on your expected volumes. We also reserve the right to automatically upgrade your account to the appropriate tier, prorated for the remaining duration of your initial annual billing period.

#### What happens if my query volume decreases? Will Engine automatically downgrade my plan to a lower tier?

If your query volume decreases to a different volume tier, you may request a downgrade to take place at your next renewal date (monthly or annual). Engine will not automatically downgrade you to a lower volume plan.

#### Do I get one million “free” queries in a paid Engine plan?

No, free queries are only available in the free Engine Community plan (up to one million per monthly usage period).

#### Can I “rollover” or get credit for unused query volume?

No, Engine query volume in your plan is based on a “use-it-or-lose it” maximum limit — there is no “rollover” or credit for unused monthly volume for monthly or annual plan customers.

<h2 id="payment">Billing and payment</h2>

You will be charged for your Engine subscription plan at the beginning of each usage period, based on your request volume, and billing term you select (monthly or annually). Your Engine subscription plan automatically renews each billing term.

#### What payment methods can I use to pay for an Engine plan?

Accepted payment methods include major credit cards (Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover) or PayPal.

#### How do I change the payment method associated with my Engine account?

You can view and update your payment method in the Settings page of your Engine account.

#### Can I pay via check or ACH instead of a credit card?

Depending on the size of the invoice and billing term, you may arrange for alternative payment methods. Please contact our solutions team for more details.

#### Where do I find invoice statements of past payments?

You can access all past invoices for your Engine account in the Settings page of your account. The billing contact of your account will also receive a statement via email.
