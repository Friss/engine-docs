description: The single source of truth for your GraphQL schema
---

Your GraphQL schema is the life blood of your application, but schemas are often hard to keep track ofâ€”especially at high development velocity. With Engine's powerful schema registry, there is always one source of truth for your schema, and Engine's _Schema Explorer_ is the place to see it. This view in Engine is the hub for your development team and provides the information product developers need when building features.

<h2 id="schema-content">Type List</h2>

Most schemas are complex webs of concepts, making it easy for even experienced developers to get lost in their schema and difficult for new developers to learn a new schema. The Schema Explorer displays a list of all the types and fields in your schema, along with their doc strings, so developers can quickly explore your schema. Related types are hyperlinked for fast navigation.

<h2 id="schema-content">Field Usage</h2>

When you [send usage metrics](./setup-apollo-server.html), you will also see usage stats on each field in your schema. _Total Requests_ gives you a sense of how in demand a field was in the past hour, while _Total Duration_ (requests multiplied by service time) lets you know how expensive the field is. Sort by either one of these fields to focus on the types/fields that matter most to the performance of your application.
